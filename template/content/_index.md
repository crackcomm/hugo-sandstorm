Welcome to your new Sandstorm-hosted Hugo site! Here are a few pointers to help you get started:

 * Check out the Git repository associated with this site. Find instructions for doing so on the grain's launch screen.
 * Choose a theme to make your site look nice. [Hugo's theme showcase](https://themes.gohugo.io) is a good place to start.
 * Add the theme to your Git repository as a [subtree](https://medium.com/@v/git-subtrees-a-tutorial-6ff568381844#.5xxwesuj8) at `themes/themename`.
 * Add `theme = "themename"` to *Config.toml*.
 * Push the repository, and your new site will be immediately published.
 * Use the administrative interface, linked from the grain's launch screen, to make simple changes without accessing the repository. Note that changes go live as soon as they are made.
 * Read more about Hugo in its extensive [documentation](https://gohugo.io/overview/introduction/).

Enjoy!
